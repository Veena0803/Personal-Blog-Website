              There are so many things that we can learn, and so many resources that we can 
              choose to learn from that it makes it really challenging to choose the right 
              resources that can help us get better jobs, or improve our careers in general. 
              Udacity offers many nano-degrees that we can use to level up our careers with 
              courses that are organized and prepared to help us progress from a beginner level 
              to a more advanced one with quality content. Students who manage to finish the 
              projects get the degree and are guaranteed to get a job related to the degree. 
              If you cannot afford to pay for these nano degrees, fortunately, you can still 
              attend many of the courses that belong to these nano degrees, without having to 
              pay anything.
